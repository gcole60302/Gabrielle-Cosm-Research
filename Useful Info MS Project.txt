IDL 
	How to run the code when shuffled into home director (check out idl tutorial, compling in idl code, or running an idl code)
	 
To log onto sptcloud:
Open a Cygwin terminal
Use startxwin command to open independent terminal
export DISPLAY=:0.0 (most likely will not use)
deroak7_Xbilem
passwd  changing password
ssh  –Y –i /cygdrive/c/Users/Gabrielle/.ssh/_git_key gcole@128.135.158.235
To Open text editor:
Emacs <filename> & (make sure to include the & to keep the command line open
To Run code in idl:
.rn <filename>
To access key:
cd cygdrive/c/Users/Gabrielle/.ssh
in this directory should be _git_key and git_key.pub
Useful notes about Existing code
assessing it
emacs .bashrc
cvs co spt_analysis 

Useful tips about whatever
Less <filename>  to display file information
~/   to copy something to my home directory
scp  send copy to “file name from” and “file name to”
ctrl x ctrl c   exit emacs
ctrl x ctrl s   save in emacs
pwd  present working directory, tell you where you currently are 
when working in terminal use /cygdrive/c/Users/Gabrielle to get to files on computer
cd  (..)  (change directory) (or go back to home directory)
ls  (list directory contents)
ls –a   (list all directory contents)
chmod <filename>  changes permissions on a file
Running To-Do list
Understand the imputs and what is going on there as well as the outputs and how they are being manipulated
Try out running the code in idl. 


Python Commands
ipy  to open ipython from terminal
Len() = length of an array or string
.append() = add something to end of an array
<= less than or equal to….etc, etc.
elif = ‘else if’
.insert(place #, what you want to incert)
range(starting number, ending number+1, step size of increments)
for i in range(len(a)):   a is some list or array
for w in words:  w is like an index over the list or array “words”
break  denotes a break in a for loop
continue  for continuing in interiation within a for loop
def “function name” allow you to define a function
man <command>  brngs up more infor


IDL Commands:
Capitalization & spaces don’t matter in idl
Print, a  prints the value of a
Help, a  prints value of a and tells if it is a float or interger, etc.
&  can be used to link to operations to each other
A = [1,2,4.54,3]  creates an array with the given values.
Print, max(a)  prints the max of the array a
Print, total(a)  prints the total of the array a
A = fltarr(100)  creates array of 100 floating numbers = to 0 
A = findgen(100)  creates array of 100 numbers from 0 to 99
A[i;j]  allows you to index an array
A = fltarr(i, j)  creates array with i x j elements
!<system variable>  denotes some read only global variables
3.4d-4  3.4 x 10^-4
3d  3.000000 (instead of  just 3)
Randomu(seed, 230)  creates 230 random array of numbers bwt 0 and 1
